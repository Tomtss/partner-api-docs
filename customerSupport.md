# Customer Support
Voi is responsible for any service cases related to the ride, accidents, police and insurance. Any other requests are handled by the partner. If service requests are sent to the wrong customer support, Customer support forwards them to their counterpart. Refunds are always performed by the partner, but sometime requested by Voi.

Voi aims to respond to any customer support errand within 2 hours, and within 30 minutes for urgent matters.

## Ways for users and partners to contact Voi customer support.
We use email for customer support.(In our app and on our webpage you can also fill in a form, but this is converted into an email). For regulatory reasons, we also provide phone-support in some markets. Phone have no access to admin tools, meaning they can answer simpl questions and most users calling in will get referred to e-mail-support.

Voi uses the email-adress and, if available, the 4-letter code next to the QR-code on the scooters to identify the users in our internal systems. We need the same thing, and the name of your app, from partners.

Please provide this e-mail as the primary means of communication: [support@voiapp.io](support@voiapp.io)

## Contacting partners customer support
Voi will need the following information provided to our customer support, in order to perform customer support:
* A way to contact your customer support.
* A way to request that refunds are performed.

We will provide you with the users e-mail when contacting your customer support.
