# Design
## Images

## Example


## Onboarding animations
Voi encourages you to use our animations for onboarding users. We use a framework called [Lottie](https://lottiefiles.com/), an iOS, Android, and React Native library that renders After Effects animations in real time, allowing apps to use animations as easily as they use static images. See files below.
