# Customer Support
Voi is responsible for any service cases related to the ride, accidents and police. Any other requests are handled by the partner. By presenting Voi contact information while the user is unlocking, riding and unlocking the scooter, most support cases end up in the right place. If service requests are sent to the wrong customer support, Customer support forwards them to their counterpart at the other company. Refunds are always performed by the partner, but sometime requested by Voi.

Voi aims to respond to any customer support errand within 2 hours, and within 30 minutes for urgent matters.

## Ways for users and partners to contact Voi customer support.
We use email for customer support.(In our app and on our webpage you can also fill in a form, but this is converted into an email). For regulatory reasons, we also provide phone-support in some markets. Phone have no access to admin tools, meaning they can answer simpl questions and most users calling in will get referred to e-mail-support.

Voi uses the email-adress and, if available, the 4-letter code next to the QR-code on the scooters to identify the users in our internal systems. We need the same info, and the name of your app when you contact our support.

Please provide this e-mail as the primary means of communication: [support@voiapp.io](support@voiapp.io)

# Service cases
## Performing Refunds
### Partner
For active rides, Voi customer support will end them and set the price. For already ended rides with serious issues , the partner is free to perform refunds for any extra costs. The gas not working is a serious issue, a broken bell is not. 

The refund offered for serious issues is of up to 10€, offer coupons if it's more than that. (Unless the user specifically states that they need a refund in money.) 

For minor issues you can offer a 1€ voucher if it affected the user experience a lot.

The partner has to keep track of offered refunds and deduct them from amount owed when invoicing Voi.
### Voi
When Voi want to request a refund from a partner, we will contact you with the following information: 
* The users e-mail
* the sum to refund 
* the time+date of the ride.
