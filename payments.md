# Payment flow
When a user finishes a ride, Voi calculates the total price of the ride and returns this to the partner. The partner then charges the end user for the ride. The partner is responsible for making sure they can collect the money from the end-user, including fraud prevention.

# Prices and fees
Pricing is constantly evolving but typically consists of a fixed fee and a minute fee. 

__End ride fines__ If the user leaves the scooter in a non parking zone, Voi may add an additional fee before ending the ride. This will be included in the end-ride charge.

__Free rides__ If the users ride for less than 100 meters or less than 2 minutes, we will not charge for the ride. For free rides, it's optional for the partner to present reciepts and/or add them to the invoicing material.

__Refunds__ The partner is responsible for performing refunds based on customer support criteria. 

__Parking fees etc__ Voi don't performs any additional charges after the ride is ended.


# Invoicing material
On a regular basis (defined in the contract), the partner will provide Voi with invoicing material, including a list of refunded rides, comissions  and total amount owed.

# Invoicing details
If the partner is to invoice Voi, use the following invoicing details.
