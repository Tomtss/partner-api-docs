# Payment flow
When a user finishes a ride, Voi calculates the total price of the ride and returns this to the partner. The partner then charges the end user for the ride. The partner is responsible for making sure they can collect the money from the end-user.


# Payment amounts
Pricing is constantly evolving but typically consists of a fixed fee and a minute fee. 

## End ride Fines
If the user leaves the scooter in a non parking zone, Voi may add an additional fee before ending the ride. 

## Free rides
If the users ride is less than 100 meters long or less than 2 minutes we will not charge for the ride. For free rides, it's optional for the partner to present reciepts and add it to the invoicing material.

## Refunds
The partner is responsible for performing refunds based on customer support criteria. 

## Additional charges to the user


# Invoicing material
On a regular basis defined in the contract, the partner will provide Voi with invoicing material, including a list of refunded rides, total amount owed "End ride charged" - Refunds - Partner comissions
