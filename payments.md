# Payment flow
When a user finishes a ride, Voi calculates the total price of the ride and returns this to the partner. The partner then charges the end user for the ride. On a regular basis, the partner will provide Voi with invoicing material, including a list of refunded rides, comissions and total amount owed. How often invoices are sent is defined in the contract between Voi and the partner.

# Prices and fees
Pricing is under active development and constantly evolving, but it typically consists of a fixed fee and a minute fee. Below are other conditions that will also impact the price of the ride.

__End ride fines__ If the user leaves the scooter in a non parking zone, Voi may add an additional fee before ending the ride. This will be included in the end-ride charge.

__Free rides__ If the users ride for less than 100 meters or less than 2 minutes, we will not charge for the ride. It is optional for the partner to present reciepts and/or add theese rides to the invoicing material.

__Refunds__ The partner is responsible for performing refunds, when this is done is defined in the customer support criteria.

__Parking fees etc__ Voi don't performs any additional charges after the ride is ended.

# Fraud
The partner is responsible for making sure they can collect the money from the end-user, including fraud prevention. (We do a 5€ pre auth payment before the first ride. The partner can do what ever they want.)

# Invoicing details
The partner can either deduct their comission from the amout owed, or send a separate invoice to Voi for their comission. If the partner is to invoice Voi, use the following invoicing details.
